Please design and write the code for a fully functional ESP32-Dev-Module application, using the Platform IO IDE that meets the following requirements:

Full App functionality and walk through requirements:
1. First time run (or whenever a factory reset is performed) - Start the ESP32 in AP(and STA) mode, wait for connection of a device and open a First configuration page, the main reason for this is to store the main credentials (in NVS as I do not want the code to be housing any credentials), using network scanner, list all wifi AP in the area, make sure to print SSID, BSSID and RSSI for each one and allow storage of upto 3 pairs, (after each SSID is set, run a connection test and validate credentials), then store the OTA credentials and HTTS(s) authentication credentials, next field would be the hostname for mDNS (for accesing the device as hostname.local), the next setting will be for the normal webserver port, (remote) debug port and (remote) OTA port. After all these have been set, close the config manager and reboot the esp32 to normal operation (do not run this config manager ever, unless a factory reset is performed). 
2. On normal operation, start up the ESP, Connect to Wifi, display connected IP address and hostname, display SPIFFS file structure, load up all the modules and when everything is good to go print a message "Start-up complete, Running Version $ver, on IP: $IP, Webserver on port: $port, SSID: $SSID, hostname $hostname, /nYou can access the device at http(s)://IP:$port/index.html or http(s)://hostname.local:$port/index.html" 
3. All 3 Sensors should have a comprehensive initialisation routine, complex error handling and recovery. Should also have configurations available in the profile manager for how often they are read and how often updates should be published on the graphs and logs.
4. All relay modules should have the following configurations (assigned by default but also editable in the frontend), 
RelayConfig: assign names, assigns pins, operation times, user overwrite time (default, configurable 5 minutes), dependency, visibility (in the frontend)
	1. Main PSU, (PIN16), (00:00-23:59), (user overwrite), independent, not visible
	2. UV Light, (PIN17), (00:00-23:59), (user overwrite), depends on relay1, visible   
	3. Grow Light, (PIN119), (00:00-23:59),  (user overwrite), independent, visible
	4. Tub Fans, (PIN26), (00:00-23:59),  (user overwrite), depends on relay1, visible 
	5. Humidifiers, (PIN33), (00:00-23:59),  (user overwrite), depends on relay1, visible 
	6. Heater, (PIN23), (00:00-23:59),  (user overwrite),  independent, visible
	7. IN/OUT Fans, (PIN25), (00:00-23:59),  (user overwrite), depends on relay1, visible 
	8. Reserved, (PIN35), (00:00-23:59),  (user overwrite), independent, not visible
Relay logic: Relay 1 must be turned on prior to turning on relays 2,4,5 and 7, and off if there is no dependency (dependencies should be configurable in frontend), Relays 2,3,4,5,6 and 7 should only operate in the set time frames regardless of reading from sensors, only user will be able to overwrite. Detailed relay automation and functionality:
1. RUN when needed by other dependants, turn off afterwards,
2&3. Run only in the given timeframe, alternating on and off with relay 3, on a pattern of run 1 for x minutes every y minutes, turn off and do the same thing with relay 3, or if manual overwrite by user
4. Tub fans should be triggered as follows: by automation parameter, run only in the given timeframe, for x minutes every y minutes (60 minutes), alternatively if CO2 read by the SCDC40 is lover than 1100, but not more than the normal operation schedule, always run in parallel with humidifier relay despite CO2 reading, or if manual overwrite by user 
5. Humidifiers should be triggered as follows: by automation parameter, run only in the given timeframe, run if average humidity reading from all 3 sensors is lower than 50% until humidity rises to >85%, run in parallel with relay 7 despite readings, or if manual overwrite by user
6. Heater should only run when the average temperature read by all 3 sensors is under 20C and up to 24C, or if manual overwrite by user
7. IN/OUT Fans, should be run only in the set time frame for x minutes every y minutes or if CO2 from the SCD40 reading is >1600 until under 1000, or if manual overwrite by user
All these parameters should be easy available to configure/edit in the frontend.
For a later time, my intention is to replace relays 1 and 6 with Tapo P100 smart sockets(therefore the Tapo P100 implementation)

5. The web page(app) should be simple, intuitive and professional looking, also all screens friendly (responsive), should also have live indicators of updating readings and graphs (blinking bullets) 						
	*Should have a main dashboard where all live sensor reads should be visible, live graphs for temperature and humidity, live relay toggles with status(on/off coloured for relays 2,3,4,5,6 and 7)  *Should have a settings page where user can configure pins for sensors and relays, also timers and automation parameters, sensor reading frequency graph update frequency and graph points, logging level selector and display, also al reboot scheduler (day of the week and time, to schedule automatic reboots), 
	*Should have a network manager page where all network parameters including ssids and passwords can be changed, mqtt parameters to be set, changing of hostname and switching from dhcp to static ip as well as setting the watcher for network stability (changing ssids in case of bad signal or disconnection)
	*Should have a profiles page where all automation parameters could be set, loaded, saved, exported or imported, app should benefit from multiple profiles and user should be able to easily switch between them. 
	*Should have system page where all operating parameters and logs are shown (wifi ssid, rssi, space used by spiffs and FW, but also heap (with progress bars), Filesystem file view with links to every file, 
	*Should have a OTA page with ability to upload firmware.bin or spiffs.bin files separately, a version display system and a version checker system.
	*A page where to configure number of TAPO devices (P100 sockets), set username, password, ip and other parameters and to replace what relay (reference here https://github.com/ClementNerma/tapo-rest, https://github.com/mihai-dinculescu/tapo/tree/main/tapo, https://github.com/omegahiro/tapo-esp32/)

6. The ap should also benefit from manual flashing of fw or spiffs over wifi, Remote Debugging (remote serial console) File System Management (Uploading and downloading or replacing files), reference here: https://github.com/chrsdme/RemoteManagerESP32/tree/main

A. Backend

1. Implement RTOS from the start Efficient Multitasking, Improved System Reliability, Symmetric Multiprocessing (SMP), Priority-Based Scheduling, Task Management, Interrupt Handling, Memory Management, Synchronization, Timing and Scheduling, Power Management, File System, Debugging and Profiling, Event Handling. Think of a firm implementation of it so the esp will use both cores to run parallel:
- time slot management to run tasks in parallel (wifi, reading sensors, keeping timers, automating relays, checking relays, updating web, reading web)
- protection that tasks are kept separated and alive (Keep WiFi Connection Alive and connected)
- task to task communication (ensure sensor are properly initialised and if error count on measure reaches x reads errors in a row, then reinitialise, if that fails, then do something else, similar approach for the web socket)
- sharing of common resources and ensure tasks are well synchronised 
- fast reaction time using interrupts 
- background process execution using priorities (create a scheduler-coordinator tasks and routines for all tasks, differentiating priorities, try and avoid livelocks, deadlocks and starvation)
- protection of critical sections (spinlocks) (wifi connectivity, web sockets, sensor reads, time management)
- use queues for reading sensors, updating graphs, timing of relays, watchdog functions, error handling and error correction, heap management, to read frontend and update backend and vice versa,  
- use semaphores/mutex when reading values from dht and scd so no resources will not be overwhelmed. 
- use timers and delays to get values from the backend and pull/push them to the frontend and back instead of constantly asking from the frontend for updates. 
- implement a mechanism to prevent watchdog timers from being triggered by Priority Inversion (bounded priority inversion, prioritize tasks by queues) 

2. Complete modular code, create modules for each component:
	1. Core App (main app and RTOS config) * Central orchestrator of all modules * Manages system-wide configurations, start-up routines, resource allocation, and overall system stability, Configures and manages the Real-Time Operating System (RTOS), Security and Authentication Manager * Manages security-related functions, including user authentication, API key management, encryption, and secure communication protocols.

	2. Network Manager (Handles all networking settings (static/dhcp ip allocation, mDNS, hostname), including WIFI, fallback connectivity options, and connection quality monitoring * Maintains a robust connection to an MQTT broker and handles topic subscriptions and publications).

	3. System Manager (composed of: A. Storage Manager-Abstracts access to SPIFFS and handles read/write operations, corruption recovery, and file structure organization * Manages persistent storage of settings, logs, cache, and automation scripts * Enables configurations to be saved, B. Time and Synchronization Manager - Synchronizes system time with external NTP servers and manages real-time clock (RTC) functions * Provides time zone adjustments and internal timers for scheduling operations. C. Maintenance and Diagnostics Manager - Includes a testing suite and fallback routines for all hardware * Implements watchdog, error recovery mechanisms, system diagnostics, and self-testing & healing routines D. Debug and Logging Manager - * Provides tools for debugging and troubleshooting the system * Handles all configurations and operations for logging and reporting, including different log levels, log rotation, remote logging & exporting, performance metrics, and system health monitoring, E. Power and Energy Manager - * Handles power-saving policies, sleep/wake routines, deep sleep modes, and wakeup triggers based on sensor events or schedules * Monitors battery levels (if applicable) and optimizes energy consumption where possible * (Note: Disabling Bluetooth without affecting WiFi is possible, but it depends on the specific hardware and firmware implementation. You may need to consult the documentation for your specific device or module.). F. Notification and Alert Manager - * Centralized management of alerts and notifications via different channels like email, Telegram, SMS, or push notifications * Implements configurable escalation levels, notification retry mechanisms, and rule-based filtering for critical events G. Profile Manager - suite for creating and loading custom user configurations and saving them as profiles for later use).

	4. Web and API Manager - Serves a web-based UI and manages HTTP/S endpoints, handling authentication and responsiveness * Defines and manages API endpoints for internal and external integrations.

	5. OTA and Firmware Manager - * Handles firmware updates via OTA, including version validation, update verification, and rollback mechanisms, Version and Update Manager * Keeps track of firmware versioning, module compatibility checks, and configuration migrations between software updates * Provides rollback points and enables smooth transitions when updating system components.

	6. Components and automation - Handles all configurations for sensors, relays, and other devices (Tapo sockets,separate implementation) and operations for automation, unattended operation, control of relays and Tapo smart sockets, Handles all sensor configuration and operation, including calibration routines, health monitoring, and data validation.


3. Use non blocking code (do not use delay unless really needed, use vtaskdelay, vtasksuspend/vtaskresume, taskhandle and ensure while loops are properly implemented)
4. Memory Management prevent stack overflows and memory leaks (static variables (enable define configSUPPORT_STATIC_ALLOCATION 1), stack memory, heap(dynamic allocation), (use heap1,4 or 5 rtos heap allocation schemes)
5. Please ensure that the application is secure and follows best practices for security and data protection.
6. Think of all the logic and integrate all endpoints needed for the frontend and ensure 100% efficient, funcitonal, usable integration.
7. Well document all the code and use //explanations of functions wherever possible 
8. Generate a custom partition table for the esp (debload all useless partitions and make sure there is enough space for app0, app1 and OTA, spiffs partition is needed for 300 KB or less as all logging will be piped to an external local network destination, available through an endpoint and configurable in settings)
9. Use the following libraries: BootWiFi.h and sdkconfig.h For the wifi access point, SensirionI2cScd4x.h for the SCD40 sensor, DHT.h for the DHT22 Sensors, ESPmDNS.h for setting the mDNS parameter, WiFi.h, WiFiMulti, for handling wifi functionality, esp_partition.h for handling partition and FS operations, nvs_flash.h, nvs.h for NVS functions, add in anything else that is necessary for this project.
10. Use these default pin allocations(override if set in initial setup otherwise).
// ----- Default Pin Definitions & Relay naming-----
RELAY1_PIN 16  // Main PSU (always turn ON before RELAYS 2,4,5 and 7, and turn off after none of them are left on)
RELAY2_PIN 17  // UV Light (depends on RELAY1)
RELAY3_PIN 19  // Grow Light 
RELAY4_PIN 26  // Fans (depends on RELAY1)
RELAY5_PIN 33  // Humidifier (depends on RELAY1)
RELAY6_PIN 23  // Tube Heater (planning to replace it with a TapoP100 socket)
RELAY7_PIN 25  // IN/OUT Fans (depends on RELAY1)
RELAY8_PIN 35  // Reserved for future use

// ----- Default Sensor Definitions -----
DHT1_PIN 13 //Upper DHT
DHT2_PIN 14 //Lower DHT
DHTTYPE DHT22
SCD40_SDA_PIN 21
SCD40_SCL_PIN 22

11. Apart from the above guidelines, the app should be able to:
	a. on first startup(or factory reset), the esp should erect its own WIFI AP, (WiFi.mode(WIFI_AP)WIFI_AUTH_OPEN), once user is connected to it, open a page with a configurator modal at http://192.168.4.1, split in cathegories: 1. button for WIFI (opens a popup wifi scanner (WiFi.scanNetworks();), show the best 10 ssids (struct NetworkInfo {     String ssid;     int rssi;     uint8_t bssid;   for (int i = 0; i < numNetworks; i++) {     String currentSSID = WiFi.SSID(i);     int currentRssi = WiFi.RSSI(i);     uint8_t currentBSSID;     WiFi.BSSID(i, currentBSSID), basically Show in this format, "SSID, MAC, RSSI", also serial print the results) and config for passwords, be able to store 3 pairs of SSIDs and passwords for multiple AP, be able to scan for Access points and differentiate them by MAC), Store values as Wifi_SSID1+WIFI_Pass1, Wifi_SSID2+WIFI_Pass2 and Wifi_SSID3+WIFI_Pass3 etc, also add a text field for hostname for mdns these are mandatory, 2.HTTP Authetication, fields for default http(s) authentication user and password, these are mandatory, 3.MQTT, input fields for the configuration of MQTT (user,pass,topic, broker etc) these are optional, 4. GPIO config, a toggle for using default GPIO configuration (given in the backend), set by default or alternative configuration, when flipped to alternative, reveal fields to store the following (UpperDHT_PIN, LowerDHT_PIN, SCD_SDA_PIN, SCD_SCL_PIN, Relay1_PIN, Relay2_PIN, Relay3_PIN, Relay4_PIN, Relay5_PIN, Relay6_PIN, Relay7_PIN and Relay8_PIN,), these are mandatory, 5.Update timings, text fields to configure the following: DHT read intervals, SCD read intervals, Graph update interval and Number of points for the graph these are mandatory, 6.Relay config, text fields for: Humidity Low and High Thresholds, Temperature Low and High Thresholds, CO2 Low and High Thresholds, and user override fallback timer, not mandatory fields, 7. Save button, then  all these configurations should be stored as static variables, in a file in the firmware(maybe use nvs_set_str or something similar?), and be made available as a base_default_config.json, close the AP mdoe and reboot to normal operation. once rebooted, load the configuration file. This config file should be available and editable from the configuration modals available in the web interface later in normal boot. Wifi Credentials should be stored in NVS but also available for editing. The name space in NVS is bootwifi.
	
	b. Connect to a Wi-Fi network stored prior(WiFi.mode(WIFI_STA)), (if the previously saved credentials do not work or network is not available, revert back to point a. and start the AP mode again and only select 1 SSID), and establish a secure connection to a remote server using MQTT protocol if set in the config, else ignore. No wifi credentials or other security sensitive information will be hardcoded in the app. Once connected to the wifi network and IP is available, print the following info into the console, "Connected to WIFI, IP: $IP!, Webpage available at: http(s)://mdns_hostname.local/index.html". If MQTT is configured and connected, print this as well, "MQTT client, connected!" else ignore until truly connected. 
	
	c. Start the Secure Webserver and print out what port its running on in the console, then initialize SPIFFS and make FS available, then print a message in the console with all files in the spiffs (this console log is just for debugging purposes initially and will be deactivated in production, document it in the code)
	
	d. Start initializig sensors, use 2 threads, 1 for the dht and 1 for the scd, add 5 seconds warm up time, once done, try the first measurement and print it in the console as U_DHT_Temperature: xx C / Humidity: yy %, L_DHT_Temperature: xx C / Humidity: yy %, SCD_Temperature: xx C / Humidity: yy %, CO2: zzz ppm. 
	
	e. Create and implement all necesary endpoints and document them. 

	f. The application should be able to read data from multiple sensors (2xDHT22 and 1xSCD40, temperature, humidity, and CO2) and send the data to the front end and also make it available via api for remote server but also post via mqtt at regular intervals.
	
	g. The application should be able to receive commands from the web interface or remote server via api or mqtt and control the ESP32's GPIO pins accordingly, also be able to handle errors and exceptions, and provide a comprehensive mechanism for debugging and logging, the application should be power efficient and optimized for low power consumption and efficient use of resources when set to use batteries power but not limited to, various sleep modes should be available to configure, including scheduling days and times.
	
	h. Please provide the complete backend code, including all necessary libraries, headers, and configuration files (point to names or download links, will be using platform io IDE).
	
	
B. Frontend

1. The interface should be written in HTML/CSS/JavaScript, be optimised for all browsers, screens and devices (laptops, tablets and mobile phones, so a responsive design will be needed, use bootstrap or something else ?).
2. Look professional and have a intuitive feel, be functional, Use a global theme.
3. Must be able to switch between light and dark mode seamlessly on all pages and modals.  
4. Must be easy customizable (provide instructions in user manual part in documentation) 
5. The interface should be very user friendly and rich in configuration for all parameters(details below)
6. The interface should be able to send commands to the ESP32's GPIO pins and control the device remotely.
7. The interface should be able to handle errors and exceptions, and provide a mechanism for debugging and logging(configurable logging level, option to export logs via file or endpoint to pipe to a network destination).
8. Interface should have the following:
	a. init_cfg.html - first configuration page (defined in Backend, point 11 a.) (available only in case of factory reset or first boot, when where are no wifi credential stored, use ESP in AP mode)
	b. index.html - main Dashboard, - should have a top title/menu banner with the following(from left to right, light/darkmode toggle button, use an icon with a light bulb; a clear graph button, that when clicked, will clear the contents of both graphs and all stored graph data, Profiles(opens the profiles modal in window mode) in the centre, the title <h1> Mushroom Tent Controller; then followed by the actual menu: Settings(opens the settings_modal in window mode), Network(opens the network modal in window mode); System(system.html, target _self)
									- default startup page, will display 2 graphs(1 for the temperature left side and 1 for humidity, right side; both graphs will show temp and humidity, from all 3 sensors, use distinct legend colouring (try and avoid using red, yellow, orange and green as they are being used for live display thresholds), use same colouring for each sensor in both graphs), graph points and update interval should be initially configured in the init_cfg but also available to edit/reconfigure in the settings_modal.html; each graph should display a blinking dot in the upper right side, when they are being updated, use an orange bullet for the temp graph and a cyan one for humidity.
									- under the graphs, there should be 3 sensor boxes with live display data from each sensor, First DHT will be UpperDHT, second will be LowerDHT and third will be SCD. For the first 2 boxes (DHT), there should be 2 lines 1 under the other Temperature and Humidity, in this order, For the SCD, add a 3rd line for CO2. All boxes sould display a blinking dot in the right corner when values are read from sensors and updated in the display boxes. Colouring of the dots should be the same as the colours used in the graph legends above. In the settings_modal, add temperature humidity and co2 low and high thresholds to define colouring for live display values colours(display values in red for under low and over high thresholds, green for ideal and orange for just under or above ideal.
									- under the sensor boxes display toggles for relays 2,3,4,5,6 and 7, using there display name, colour the toggles in red to correspond when the relay is OFF and in green when its ON, use this collaring as default, despite the cause that the relay is toggled (automatic schedule, automatic environmental, or manual user. Ensure at startup, all relays are off by default and then read the environmental configuration and schedules from the config file. Timers, and trigger values and schedules should be configurable and editable/exportable/importable from the profiles_modal.
					- profiles_modal - will have a profile selector, dropdown list(3 profiles: Test(default selected),Colonisation,Fruiting) followed by buttons(Load, Save, Rename, ExportALL and ImportAll(load will populate all text boxes with the stored values from json, Save, will save them to the corresponding selected profile in JSON and also apply them for use, Rename will rename the profile name, conserving all values, ExportALL will export the whole profiles.json file with all profiles in it, Import, will import the file, overwriting the one in spiffs and will apply the first profile in the list. Following that the categories of configs are as follows: 
					a. Graphs, will have 2 text fields 1 for Graph Update Interval (sec): and the other for Graph Max Points:; 
					b. Sensors - DHT Sensor Interval (sec):, SCD40 Sensor Interval (sec):;
