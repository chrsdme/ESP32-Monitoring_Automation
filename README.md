# Mushroom Tent Controller

## Overview

The Mushroom Tent Controller is a comprehensive ESP32-based system designed to automate and monitor mushroom cultivation environments. This project provides precise control over environmental factors essential for successful mushroom growing, including temperature, humidity, CO2 levels, and lighting schedules.

## Features

- **Environmental Monitoring**: Real-time tracking of temperature, humidity, and CO2 levels using DHT22 and SCD40 sensors
- **Automated Control**: Intelligent management of heating, humidification, lighting, and ventilation systems
- **Multiple Operation Modes**: Pre-configured profiles for different growing stages (Colonization, Fruiting)
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Responsive web interface accessible from any device with a browser
- **WiFi Connectivity**: Reliable wireless connection with failover options and network quality monitoring
- **Data Visualization**: Real-time graphs for environmental metrics
- **Smart Device Integration**: Compatible with Tapo P100 smart plugs for enhanced control
- **Profile Management**: Save, load, and customize growing profiles for different mushroom varieties
- **OTA Updates**: Remote firmware and file system updates

## Hardware Requirements

- ESP32-Dev-Module
- 2Ã— DHT22 temperature and humidity sensors
- SCD40 CO2 sensor
- 8-channel relay module
- Optional: Tapo P100 smart plugs (can replace physical relays)

## Software Architecture

The Mushroom Tent Controller is built using a modular, RTOS-based approach:

- **Core Modules**: System orchestration, task management, and security
- **Network Management**: WiFi connectivity, MQTT communication, and fallback mechanisms
- **Sensor Interface**: Temperature, humidity, and CO2 monitoring with error recovery
- **Relay Control**: Intelligent automation based on environmental readings and schedules
- **Web Interface**: Responsive dashboard and configuration pages
